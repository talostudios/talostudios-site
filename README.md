# Talo Studios
Talo Studios is the name of my personal site. The goal of this site is to house the variety of projects across disciplines that I'm interested in trying out. *Talo* is a shortened version of *intentalo* which translates to *try it*. This is a sentiment my mother instilled in me and what I hope to carry out with this project.
